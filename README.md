# How to run

1. ensure node.js and typescript is installed globally `npm install -g typescript`
2. if necessary delete all .js files and recompile with `tsc`
3. then if step 2 not necessary, run `node index.js` in terminal and see results printed to console
4. if confused by print results look to `index.ts`, the file explains each print statement and whats happening
